    "**Deadline:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Assignment 1 is due Thursday, September 21 at 11:59pm. Late work will not be accepted as per the course policies (see the syllabus on [Canvas](https://canvas.yale.edu)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Sharing code or any written work is not okay, but discussing problems with the course staff or with other students is encouraged. Acknowledge any collaborations and source materials used.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should start early so that you have time to get help if you're stuck. The drop-in office hours schedule can be found on [Canvas](https://canvas.yale.edu).  You can also post questions or start discussions on [Ed Discussion](https://edstem.org/us/courses/44592/discussion/). The assignment may look long at first glance, but the problems are broken up into steps that should help you to make steady progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Submission:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Submit your assignment as a .pdf on Gradescope. You can access Gradescope through Canvas on the left-side of the class home page. The problems in each homework assignment are numbered. Note: When submitting on Gradescope, please select the correct pages of your pdf that correspond to each problem. This will allow graders to find your complete solution to each problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "To produce the .pdf, please do the following in order to preserve the cell structure of the notebook:  \n",
    "1.  Go to \"File\" at the top-left of your Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "2.  Under \"Download as\", select \"HTML (.html)\"\n",
    "3.  After the .html has downloaded, open it and then select \"File\" and \"Print\" (note you will not actually be printing)\n",
    "4.  From the print window, select the option to save as a .pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "**Topics**\n",
    "1. Linear regression (parametric)\n",
    "2. k-nearest-neighbor classification (nonparametric)\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment will also help you to learn the essentials of Python, Pandas, and Jupyter notebooks."

This movie appears in the test set, so let's imagine that we don't yet know its genre.\n",

As you can see in the result, *Batman Returns* is more similar to *Titanic* than to *The Avengers* based on these features.
